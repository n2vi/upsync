# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This repository is so small that I do not anticipate numbered versions.  HEAD will be supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report any vulnerability to grosse@gmail.com.
You can reasonably expect me to drop whatever else I'm doing and work on a patch immediately.
As soon as you have had a chance to confirm it, I will announce the security fix and give you credit.
